This is the source code for Binary News Gatherer.

Bnews is compiled with IBM CSet++ v2.1 + CSD's.

The directory .\Bnews and its subdirectories are stored in the archive
bnewssource.zip

There are the following prerequisites:

    OCL v1.50   - Cubus C++ OS/2 Class Library (freeware!).  This is
                  available from my web page and ftp-os2.cdrom.com.  You
                  will need the source and binaries, oclsrc15.zip and
                  oclbin15.zip.  Or just the source if you want to
                  compile it yourself.

    setloci.lib - From the Internationalization Toolkit based on XPG/4.
                  This is located on disc 3 of Devcon 12 under
                  \toolkits\i18n\lib\setloci.lib
                  This is needed for the regular expressions, regcomp(),
                  regerror(), regexec(), and regfree().

    wchar.h     - These are in \toolkits\warptlkt\toolkit\h\libc\
    locale.h      and also in \toolkits\i18n\include
    regex.h

    repack.exe  - Devcon 12 Disk 1 \devtools\repack\
                  or remove this line from the makefile
                  The debug compile doesn't not repack, so you don't
                  need this unless you make a non-debug compile.
