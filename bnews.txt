1.  Overview

Binary News Gatherer is an OS/2 text mode application for downloading an
overview and selected articles from binary news groups via NNTP.

See "History" at the end of this document for recent changes.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
2.  System Requirements

OS/2 Warp v3 or higher.

This program uses longfilenames, therefore requires HPFS.

OS/2 Warp IAK (so32dll.dll and tcp32dll.dll, and setloc1.dll).


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
3.  Quick Start

Typical usage consists of following steps:

  1.  Edit bnews.ini (first time usage only) for your system.
      See bnews.ini.

  2.  Download an overview of a group:  bnews /Covernew /G<group> /H<host>
      Overview is saved as <group>.over.txt.

  3.  Create a list of articles that you want to retrieve.  You must do
      this with your favorite text editor.  Load the <group>.over.txt
      file in your editor, and cut and paste the articles that you
      want to get, save as <group>.get.txt

  4.  Download the articles:  bnews /Cart /G<group> /H<host>
      Articles are saved in <group>.uue.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
4.  Configuration File

Bnews.ini is the configuration file.  This file is not required, but it
will save some typing at the command line.

The default configuration file is bnews.ini, in the same directory as
bnews.exe.  To specify a different configuration file, use the /Imy.ini
switch.

The configuration file can contain any valid Command Line Options,
except; /I<my.ini>

See:  bnews.ini

Parameters on the command line that appear after /imy.ini override
settings in the configuration file.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
5.  Command Line Options

/A[U|P]       AUTHINFO

              /au<username> /ap<password>

              Environment variables are searched for in the following
              order (command line overrides environment):

                USER
                USERID

                PASSWORD
                PASS
                PASSIP

              These options can also be placed in bnews.ini
              

/C<command>   ART, OVERALL, OVERNEW, NEW, NEXT, LIST, HELP

    /CART     ARTICLE - Download articles listed in <group>.get.txt.

    /COVERALL Download an overview of the entire group.

    /COVERNEW Download new overview of the group.
              (new overview only, not the entire article).

              bnews.newsrc (in the same directory as bnews.exe)
              contains the high water marks for each group.

              The format of bnews.newsrc is:

              group: highwater, highwater

              highwater = highest article since last overnew command.
              highwater = highest article since last next command.

    /CNEW     NEWNEWS - Downloads only new articles since the
              last /cnew session was run.  The file
              bnews.newstime (in the same directory as
              bnews.exe) contains the last access time for
              each group.

              The format of bnews.newstime is

              group=yymmdd hhmmss

              yymmdd hhmms = yearmonthday<space>hourminutesecond
              that the group was last accessed.

              Note:  NEWNEWS downloads *all* new articles, not
              just and overview.

              NEWNEWS can take quite a long time if the last access
              time is very old.  Try using a later access time.

              Some servers have disabled the NEWNEWS command.

    /CNEXT    Downloads articles starting with the last highest
              read article number.  This command downloads all
              new articles, not just an overview.
              bnews.newsrc (in the same directory as bnews.exe)
              contains the high water marks for each group.

              The format of bnews.newsrc is:

              group: highwater, highwater

              highwater = highest article since last overnew command.
              highwater = highest article since last next command.

    /LIST     Get a list of all newgroups from the server.
              Groups are saved in a file called <host>.list.txt.
              This can take quite a while, some servers have
              more than 20,000 news groups.

    /CHELP    Get list of commands from newsserver.
              Saved as <host>.help.txt

/G<group>     The full name of the news group to retrieve articles or an
              overview from.

              /Galt.binaries.pictures
              /Gmy.favorite.binaries.group

/H<hostname>  Your NNTP news server.

              /Hnews.your.net
              /Hnews

/I<my.ini>    Use my.ini as the configuration file.  Default is bnews.ini
              in the same directory as bnews.exe.

              /Imy.ini
              /Ix:\path\my.ini

/K<killfile>  Use killfile.  Default is bnews.kill in the same
              directory as bnews.exe.

              The format of the killfile is

              all {
                  From someone@something.com
                  Subject \$\$\$
                  Header sometrash
              }
              
              group.name {
                  From someoneelse@something.com
                  Subject FREE
                  Header sometrash
              }

              Regular expressions can be used in the group name too.

              alt.binaries* {
                  ...
              }

              Regular expressions are supported.
              All comparisons are case insensitive.

/L<logfile>   NOTE : logging is currently disabled, this switch has no
                     effect.

              Create a log file for error messages.  Default is
              bnews.log in the same path as bnews.exe.

              /L

              To specify the logfile name.

              /Lmylog.txt
              /Lx:\path\mylog.txt

/M<maxpacket> Maximum kilobytes to download this session.  Default is 1024k.
              If an article is incomplete bnews will finish downloading
              the remaining article, then quit.
              This switch only applies when /cNEXT is used.

/O            Read from stdin and write to stdout.

/P<port>      Port number.  Default is 119, this switch will probably
              never need to be used.

              /P119

/S            Sort the overview of a group by Subject.  Default is not
              to sort the group overview.  This switch only applies in
              overview mode, /cOVERALL or /cOVERNEW

/V            Verify articles exist on server before downloading begins.
              Useful when downloading multi-part messages.
              This switch only applies in articles mode, /cART.

/D            Show debug information.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
6.  Tips - Examples

Options are searched for in the following order:

    1.  Environment Variable(s) - NNTPSERVER=news.my.net
    2.  Bnews.ini
    3.  Commandline parameters

    Parameters on the command line that come before /I<my.ini> will be
    overridden if they are also defined in <my.ini>

Redirect stderr to a file to save a copy of error messages.

    bnews <options> -d 2>errlog.txt
    
Examples:

  Download an overview of the entire group:

    bnews -coverall -galt.binaries.pictures -hnews.your.net

  Download only a new overview:

    bnews -covernew -galt.binaries.pictures -hnews.your.net

  Download 2 megs of new articles:

    bnews -cnext -galt.binaries.pictures -hnew.your.net -m2048

  Download articles listed in <group>.get.txt:

    bnews -cart -galt.binaries.pictures -hnew.your.net

  Download a list of all newsgroups:

    bnews -clist -hnews.your.net

  Get a list of commands the server recognizes:

    bnews -chelp -hnews.your.net

  Read from stdin and write to stdout

    bnews -covernew -o | bnewsfilter | bnews -cart -o > art.uue
    bnews -covernew -o | bnewsfilter | bnews -cart -o | uudeview -io -


The overview is saved to a text file named <group>.over.txt.  The text
file is named by the group with ".over.txt" appended at the end of the
group's name. See "File Naming Mechanism", below.

You must have the appropriate tools (uudecode, pmuue, mime, ...) to
extract the encoded <group>.uue file.

When the /V command line option is used (only valid with /cART), bnews
verifies that the all articles exist on the server before downloading
begins.  There are rare occasions when an article(s) listed in the
overview does not exist on the server, so it seems pointless to download
6/7 to find that 7/7 doesn't exist.  At least, all articles are known to
exist when the download begins, its still possible that article(s) may
be deleted on the server after the download begins, but this is even
rarer in my experience.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
7.  File Naming Mechanism

*NOTE*:  You must provide the group's FULL NAME on the command line or
         in the configuration file.

<host>.list.txt   - List of all newsgroups created when /cLIST is used.
                    Always overwritten, truncated.

<group>.over.txt  - Overview of articles, created by bnews.
                    /coverall = Always overwritten, truncated.
                    /covernew = Never overwritten, appended.
                    
<group>.get.txt   - List of articles to get, created by you.
                    Only read.

<group>.uue       - Downloaded articles, created by bnews.
                    Never overwritten, appended.

To keep filenames shorter, the following hierarchies are abbreviated:

          alt.bbs.doors.binaries.           = a.b.d.b.
          alt.binaries.erotica.             = a.b.e.
          alt.binaries.games.               = a.b.g.
          alt.binaries.multimedia.          = a.b.m.
          alt.binaries.nude.                = a.b.n.
          alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.    = a.b.p.e.
          alt.binaries.pictures.            = a.b.p.
          alt.binaries.sounds.              = a.b.s.
          alt.binaries.warez.               = a.b.w.
          alt.binaries.                     = a.b.
          alt.games.                        = a.g.
          comp.binaries.                    = c.b.
          de.alt.binaries.                  = d.a.b.
          fj.binaries.                      = f.b.
          relcom.comp.                      = r.c.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
8.  Problems

When pasting to <group>.get.txt, care must be used to preserve the tab
(0x09) characters, otherwise the byte count will not be accurate.  This
does not affect the program's operation.  The byte count is only an
estimate the total number of bytes expected, minus the headers.
(Note: byte count is currently disabled).

The following only applies when /cART is used:

 If the download is interrupted, for any reason, the <group>.get.txt and
 <group>.uue files must be reset to the last complete message manually by
 you with your text editor.  Follow these two steps:

   1.  Load <group>.uue in your text editor, look at the end of the file
       to see if the last message is complete or incomplete.  Most
       complete uuencoded articles end with "end" as the last line.
       Delete any incomplete message at the end of the <group>.uue file.

   2.  Reset the <group>.get.txt file by deleting the articles at the
       beginning of the file which were completely downloaded, so that
       when Bnews is run again it will begin downloading the article that
       was incomplete.  You may have to look in <group>.uue to see which,
       if any, article was incomplete.

                                 ***IMPORTANT***
             If you don't follow these two steps, the encoded data in
                      <group>.uue will not decode properly!

9.  Future versions

Fix the above problems.

Improve logging.

Suggestions welcome.

11.  History

0.90  Jul 31 96 - First release.

0.91  Aug 17 96 - Touches <group>.get.txt, if it doesn't exist,
                  when downloading an overview.  Helps with

0.94a Jan 15 97 - REXX .cmd files now load the REXXUTIL functions.
                  Bnews.exe is packed with repack.exe, which means it
                  consumes less disk space, loads faster, and will run
                  only under OS/2 Warp v3 or higher.
                  Memory leaks plugged thanks to CSet++'s Debug Memory
                  Management Features (no more memory leaks, which OS/2
                  cleans up when the program terminates anyway).

                  bnews.newstime format documented.
                  Source for bnews cleaned up quite a bit, (almost a total
                  rewrite).
                  Checks for the environment variable NNTPSERVER
                  NEXT command added to get articles by number.

                  mark is 0 in bnewes.newsrc
                  Made some changes to the killfile handling. There is
                  now no limit on the number of groups or kill expressions.

0.95a Jan 01 97 - Fixed bug in /coverall - would not get an overview if
                  the highwatermark = highest article available on server.
                  Fixed bug that caused /cover* to read the wrong highwater
                  mark under certain conditions.
